# Basic Odoo project template used by [docky](https://github.com/akretion/docky)

This repo contains all the basic files needed to create an Odoo project from scratch using the [docky](https://github.com/akretion/docky) and [ak](https://github.com/akretion/ak) command-line tools developed by [Akretion](https://akretion.com).

To start a new Odoo project, you don't need to download this repo anymore :

1. Install [docky](https://github.com/akretion/docky) (version > 7.0.5)
```
pip install docky
# or with pipx : pipx install docky --include-deps
```

2. Create en *empty folder* for your Odoo projet and run `docky init` in it
```
mkdir my-odoo-project
cd my-odoo-project
docky init -b 14.0 # or '-b BRANCH_NUMBER' for other Odoo versions, see 'docky init --help'
```

3. Install [ak](https://github.com/akretion/ak)
```
pip install git+https://github.com/akretion/ak.git@master
```

4. Download the Odoo source code and other external modules specified in the [spec.yaml](odoo/spec.yaml) file using `ak build` from the spec.yaml's folder
```
cd odoo
ak build
```

> [ak](https://github.com/akretion/ak) use the [git-aggregator](https://github.com/acsone/git-aggregator) tool by [Acsone](https://www.acsone.eu/).
> More information on the [git-aggregator](https://github.com/acsone/git-aggregator) repo to understand how to fill the [spec.yaml](odoo/spec.yaml) file.


5. Once all the code is downloaded, go back to your project's root folder and launch `docky run`
```
cd ..
docky run
```

On the first `docky run`, docky will download the Odoo image referenced in the [DockerFile](odoo/Dockerfile) and run your different docker-compose files (basically docker-compose.yml, dev.docker-compose.yml or prod.docker-compose.yml) following the environment's variables registered in your **.env** file generated by the `docky init`.

To reload the Odoo docker image or to update your docky after changing you environment variables, run `docky build`.

More information on : [docky](https://github.com/akretion/docky).


# Bump and Migration

When creating migration script (pre, post...) you can name the directory "0.0.0"
Indeed Odoo always run migration script with the version "0.0.0" so you can use this as
"current" migration script for your PR.
Then when you will run the cmd "./bump" it will set the right version number.
